# Demo Environment

Some of the most challenging conversations with Stoplight customers require familiarity with the platform's open source products: [Prism](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/prism/README.md) and [Spectral333](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/README.md).
333
This project is designed to provide you with the necessary resources to learn enough about these products at a high level, such that you can demonstrate their use.
